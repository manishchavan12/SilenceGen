The tool will guide you through the process of creating a wallet, generating a seed phrase, and checking balances.

## Functionality

SilenceGen offers several key functionalities:

1. **Generate Wallet**: Create a new Solana wallet with a unique address and private key.
2. **Seed Phrase**: Automatically generate a secure seed phrase for your wallet.
3. **Check Balances**: Verify the balance of your wallet and see if it contains any funds.
4. **Log Results**: Any wallet with a non-zero balance will have its details logged in `result.txt`.

## How It Works

### Wallet Generation

When you run the program, it creates a new wallet by generating a random private key. This private key is then used to derive the wallet address. 

### Seed Phrase Creation

The tool generates a seed phrase using a secure random number generator. This phrase is essential for recovering your wallet.

### Balance Checking

SilenceGen checks the balance of the generated wallet against the Solana network. If it finds a wallet with a non-zero balance, it logs the wallet's address, mnemonic, private key, and balance into a file named `result.txt`.

### Logging Information

The logged information includes:

- Wallet Address
- Mnemonic (Seed Phrase)
- Private Key
- Balance

You can access this information anytime in the `result.txt` file created in the project directory.
